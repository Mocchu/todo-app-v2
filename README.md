<!-- ABOUT-->

## About The Project

I initially started this project to learn more about modular javascript in vanilla JS. However, it quickly became apparent that developing a project of this scale would be incredibly cumbersome without the use of a frontend framework.

Logically, I then restarted the project using React purely due to it's popularity. This was my first exposure to a frontend framework and i've learned alot.
